* Students must be able to merge their branches into their local`master` on the command line.

* Students must be able to resolve merge conflicts on their computers.
* Students must be able to request integration of their changes via PR.
* Students must be able to approve and merge PRs from GitHub.

* Students should be able to use git `stash` to save "dirty" changes to their working environment.

## Project Requirements

* The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.
* Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
* Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
